============================================================

This directory contains scripts to initialise the PyKota
storage database. Use the one which best suits your need
depending on the storage backend you want to use.

There's one subdirectory per backend type supported.

Files :
=======

  * postgresql/pykota-postgresql.sql :
  
    This file creates an empty Quota Storage Database, using PostgreSQL
    as a backend. You have to use it the first time you install PyKota
    if you want to use PostgreSQL as the Quota Storage Backend.
    
  * ldap/pykota.schema :  
  
    This file adds the necessary classes and attributes to an existing
    LDAP directory for use with PyKota. Read this file and the 
    associated ldap/README.ldap files for details.
    
    
Old files, kept to allow people to upgrade from very old versions of PyKota :   
=============================================================================
    
  * upgrade-to-1.19.sql :  
  
    This file upgrades the PostgreSQL Quota Storage Database schema
    from versions before 1.19alpha7 to version 1.19alpha7 and above.
    NEVER USE IT IF YOU ALREADY RUN 1.19alpha7 OR ABOVE !
    
  * upgrade-to-1.16.sql :  
  
    This file upgrades the PostgreSQL Quota Storage Database schema
    from versions before 1.16 to version 1.16.
    NEVER USE IT IF YOU ALREADY RUN 1.16 OR ABOVE !
    
  * upgrade-to-1.14.sql :  
  
    This file upgrades the PostgreSQL Quota Storage Database schema
    from versions before 1.14 to version 1.14.
    NEVER USE IT IF YOU ALREADY RUN 1.14 OR ABOVE !
    
  * VERYOLDpykota-upgrade-postgresql.sql :
  
    This file upgrades the PostgreSQL Quota Storage Database schema
    from versions before 1.01 to version 1.01.
    
    IT'S THERE FOR HISTORICAL REASONS ONLY : DON'T USE IT, USE
    THE SCRIPT DESCRIBED BELOW INSTEAD !
    
  * upgrade-from-before-1.03.py :
  
    This shell script upgrades the PostgreSQL Quota Storage Database schema
    from versions 1.01 or 1.02 to version 1.03.
    PLEASE DO A BACKUP OF YOUR PYKOTA DATABASE BEFORE RUNNING THIS SCRIPT !
    Also this script will try to connect to PostgreSQL as the postgres user
    (i.e. PostgreSQL's administrator), on the local machine (PyKota Storage 
    Server), without prompting for a password. Please read this script and 
    adapt it to your own configuration before running it. THIS IS IMPORTANT.
    
    THIS SCRIPT MAKES ANY REASONABLE CHECK TO ENSURE THAT YOUR DATAS WON'T 
    BE LOST, AND ALSO DUMPS YOUR OLD DATABASE TO A TEXT FILE BEFORE DOING
    ANYTHING. IT WAS TESTED SEVERAL TIMES AND SHOULDN'T PRODUCE ANY ERROR
    EXCEPT ABOUT THE pykotaadmin and pykotauser POSTGRESQL USERS WHO 
    ALREADY EXIST WHEN THE DATABASE SCHEMA IS UPGRADED. THIS IS NORMAL !
