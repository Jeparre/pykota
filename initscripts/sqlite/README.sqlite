Documentation :

pykota.sqlite :

    This file can be used to create an empty SQLite3 database
    for use with PyKota, in the case you don't want to use
    either PostgreSQL, MySQL, or LDAP :
    
    NB : an SQLite3 database can't be shared between several
    PyKota managed print servers, contrarily to the other
    database backends.
    
    HowTo :
    
      - Install SQLite v3.2.1 or higher, and its development files,
        for example on my Debian box :
        
                # apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
                
        You can also download SQLite from http://www.sqlite.org        

      - Download and install PySQLite v2.0.5 or higher from :
      
                http://www.pysqlite.org

        Install it this way :

                # tar -zxf pysqlite-2.0.5.tar.gz
                # cd pysqlite-2.0.5
                # python setup.py install
                
        Under Debian, if the package exists for your version of Debian,
        simply do :
        
                # apt-get install python-pysqlite2
                
      - Create an SQLite3 database for PyKota :

                # sqlite3 ~pykota/pykota.db <pykota.sqlite
                # chown pykota.pykota ~pykota/pykota.db
                # chmod 660 ~pykota/pykota.db
                # chown pykota.pykota ~pykota       (seems to be necessary)
                
        NB : adapt the permissions so that the user your printing
             system runs as (e.g. user 'lp') can read and write
             to the /etc/pykota/pykota.db file.
                
      - In ~pykota/pykotadmin.conf, just comment out all the lines

      - In ~pykota/pykota.conf, ensure that the following lines
        are present and unique inside the [global] section :

                storagebackend : sqlitestorage
                storagename : /etc/pykota/pykota.db
                
        And comment out all other directives which name begins with 'storage'.
        NB : feel free to use a different path to store pykota.db, and
             adapt your configuration files and permissions accordingly.
                
Your PyKota setup is now ready to be used with an SQLite3 database.             

IMPORTANT : with PyKota's SQLite backend there's no possibility to separate
readonly accesses from readwrite accesses for now, so don't set your
permissions too loosely if untrusted users have local shell access on
your print server.
