====================================================================

This directory contains scripts which may be used to query printers 
for their life time page counter, so you could define them as
hardware accounters in PyKota configuration file.

They are completely untested, and you certainely have to edit them to
make them work as part of PyKota.

Any success or failure report is more than welcome.
