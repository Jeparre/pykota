====================================================================

This directory contains CGI scripts which you may find useful to
put on a web server along with PyKota command line tools.

Be sure to restrict access to these CGI scripts as necessary.

If you protect access to printquota.cgi or dumpykota.cgi with 
username+password authentication, the REMOTE_USER CGI environment variable
is honored, so an user can only see his own datas, but not
other users' datas. However, the special REMOTE_USER value 'root'
is allowed an unrestricted access.

If no username+password authentication takes place, then access
is completely unrestricted.

If you don't protect access to pykotme.cgi with username+password
authentication, then only the job's size will be displayed
to you. This is due to the cost of a print job on a particular printer
depending on the user because of the overcharging factor's value. 
So if you want pykotme.cgi to produce complete web quotes, you must 
ensure that the user logs in from his web browser whenever he uses 
this CGI script.

You must ensure that the user your web server runs as can read
PyKota's pykota.conf configuration file. No read access to
PyKota's pykotadmin.conf configuration file is necessary though.

The web server doesn't need to be a print server nor a PyKota 
Storage Backend server, but it must contain a correctly configured 
PyKota installation.
