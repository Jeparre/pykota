=============================================================================

This directory contains checklist templates to use with Gnome's qa-assistant
utility.

Just copy the XML files from this directory to /usr/share/qa-assistant/data/

If you want to setup PyKota on a new machine, or help somebody do so,
launch qa-assitant, then start a new QA review, and choose any of the 
"PyKota Installation" templates. The other templates are unrelated
to PyKota and are installed as part of qa-assistant.

Confirm your choice and then apply it.

qa-assistant will then display a checklist describing a step by step
setup guide for PyKota. Moving the mouse cursor over each step will
explain what you have to do before deciding if this particular step
failed or passed.

IMPORTANT : currently a single "PyKota Installation" template is provided,
and it is still incomplete : it doesn't contain any database related
instructions.

If qa-assistant complains about not being able to load the PyKota template,
you should probably upgrade qa-assistant. This template is known to work
with qa-assistant v0.4.90.5
