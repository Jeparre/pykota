============================================================

Licensing information :

  * PyKota is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License of 
    the Free Software Foundation, version 2, or at your option, any higher
    version.

  * You can access to PyKota's latest development tree by using 
    SubVersion (aka SVN) :
  
      $ svn co svn://svn.librelogiciel.com/pykota/trunk pykota

  * You are encouraged to support the project by purchasing an
    unlimited entry pass to the restricted areas of http://www.pykota.com
    or a Technical Support contract.
    
    This gives you access to all the OFFICIAL packages : tar+gzip, Debian,
    Ubuntu, RPMs, etc... depending on the application, that you can
    redistribute if you want.
    
    IMPORTANT : if you redistribute an OFFICIAL package in modified form,
    PLEASE edit pykota/version.py to remove the word OFFICIAL from
    the version number. If you redistribute an OFFICIAL package in
    an unmodified form, then no problem.
    
  * I ask you to not label or present a version of PyKota downloaded 
    from SVN as being the 'OFFICIAL' one. OFFICIAL packages are
    reasonably stable and well tested before shipping, while the
    latest development tree as extracted from subversion may contain
    bugs and/or incomplete functionnalities.
