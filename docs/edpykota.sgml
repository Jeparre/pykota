  <para>
    You'll use this tool to create, manage or delete print quota entries for users
    or users groups on printers or printers groups.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    By default, before being allowed to print through <application>PyKota</application>,
    an user must exist in the database and have a print quota entry on every printer
    he should be allowed to use. As seen in the previous chapter, the simplest way to add an user named <literal>jerome</literal> to the database is
    to type :
<screen>    
$ pkusers --add jerome
</screen>

    But this is not sufficient to allow user <literal>jerome</literal> to print. You have to create a print quota entry for <literal>jerome</literal> on all printers
    he is allowed to print to. The easiest way to do so is to type :
<screen>    
$ edpykota --add jerome
</screen>
  </para>
  
  <para>
    The commands above have created user <literal>jerome</literal> in the database, and have automatically
    created print quota entries with no limit for this user on all existing printers. This means
    that user <literal>jerome</literal> is allowed to print without limitation, but that full accounting
    will still be done for this user : you'll know whenever he prints and how much.
