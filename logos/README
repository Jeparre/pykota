====================================================================

This directory contains the PyKota logo in Gimp's xcf format, as
well as 4-bit/pixel png big (925x925) and small (100x100) versions.

PyKota's logo was drawn by Joël Collet, I added the text.

IMPORTANT : I ask you to NOT use any image which displays the 
"OFFICIAL" word on it unless you use or redistribute a complete and 
unmodified version of a real "PyKota Official" package. 
    
If you redistribute a modified version of a real "PyKota Official", 
or a work based on a modified version of a real "PyKota Official" 
package, or a version of PyKota directly obtained from the CVS tree, 
please use the images which don't display the word "OFFICIAL". 

Both sets of images are included in this directory, please use the 
one which correctly describes the software you redistribute or base 
your work on. 

Thanks in advance.
