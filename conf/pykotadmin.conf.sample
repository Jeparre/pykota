# PyKota sample administrator's configuration file
#
# Under NO circumstances regular users should 
# be allowed to read this file.
#
#
# File format :
#
#   - A mandatory [global] section :
#
#     Contains configuration directives to specify the username and
#     optional password for the PyKota's database administrator.
#     This user is either a PostgreSQL or MySQL user, or an LDAP complete dn.
#     For SQLite, only the [global] section itself is required, but
#     the rest of the file can be empty.
#
# Directives format :
#
#   - Directive's name, followed by ':' followed by the directive's value.
#
#   - No leading whitespace : leading whitespace tell the parser that the
#     current directive is the continuation of the previous one. Use with
#     care and only when you need it.
