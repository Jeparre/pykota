\fB\-V\fR | \fB\-\-vat\fR p
Sets the percent value of the applicable VAT to be

Dates formatting with 'start' and 'end' filter keys :
.IP

YYYYMM : month boundaries
YYYYMMDD : day boundaries
YYYYMMDDhh : hour boundaries
YYYYMMDDhhmm : minute boundaries
YYYYMMDDhhmmss : second boundaries
yesterday[+\-NbDays] : yesterday more or less N days (e.g. : yesterday\-15)
today[+\-NbDays] : today more or less N days (e.g. : today\-15)
tomorrow[+\-NbDays] : tomorrow more or less N days (e.g. : tomorrow\-15)
now[+\-NbDays] : now more or less N days (e.g. now\-15)
.IP
\&'now' and 'today' are not exactly the same since today represents the first
or last second of the day depending on if it's used in a start= or end=
date expression. The utility to be able to specify dates in the future is
a question which remains to be answered :\-)
.IP
Contrary to other PyKota management tools, wildcard characters are not
expanded, so you can't use them.
.PP
examples :
.IP
\f(CW$ pkinvoice --unit EURO --output /tmp/invoices.pdf start=now-30\fR
.IP
Will generate a PDF document containing invoices for all users
