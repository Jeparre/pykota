.TP
\fB\-h\fR | \fB\-\-help\fR
Prints this message then exits.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR | \fB\-\-add\fR
Adds users or groups print quota entries if
they don't exist in database.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR | \fB\-\-delete\fR
Deletes users or groups print quota entries.
Users or groups are never deleted, you have
to use the pkusers command to delete them.
The history will be purge from all matching
jobs, unless \fB\-g\fR | \fB\-\-groups\fR is used.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR | \fB\-\-printer\fR p
Edit quotas on printer p only. Actually p can
use wildcards characters to select only
some printers. The default value is *, meaning
all printers.
You can specify several names or wildcards,
by separating them with commas.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR | \fB\-\-groups\fR
Edit groups print quota entries instead of
users print quota entries.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR | \fB\-\-list\fR
Lists users or groups print quota entries.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR | \fB\-\-noquota\fR
Sets both soft and hard limits to None for users
or groups print quota entries.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR | \fB\-\-reset\fR
Resets the actual page counter for the user
or group to zero on the specified printers.
The life time page counter is kept unchanged.
.TP
\fB\-R\fR | \fB\-\-hardreset\fR
Resets the actual and life time page counters
for the user or group to zero on the specified
printers. This is a shortcut for '\-\-used 0'.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR | \fB\-\-skipexisting\fR
In combination with the \fB\-\-add\fR option above, tells
edpykota to not modify existing print quota entries.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR | \fB\-\-softlimit\fR sl
Sets the quota soft limit to sl pages.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR | \fB\-\-hardlimit\fR hl
Sets the quota hard limit to hl pages.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR | \fB\-\-increase\fR v
Increase existing Soft and Hard limits by the value
of v. You can prefix v with + or \-, if no sign is
used, + is assumed.
.TP
\fB\-U\fR | \fB\-\-used\fR u
Sets the page counters for the user u pages on
the selected printers. Doesn't work for groups, since
their page counters are the sum of all their members'
page counters.
Useful for migrating users from a different system
where they have already used some pages. Actual
and Life Time page counters may be increased or decreased
if u is prefixed with + or \-.
WARNING : BOTH page counters are modified in all cases,
so be careful.
NB : if u equals '0', then the action taken is
the same as if \fB\-\-hardreset\fR was used.
.IP
user1 through userN and group1 through groupN can use wildcards
if the \fB\-\-add\fR option is not set.
.PP
examples :
.IP
\f(CW$ edpykota --add john paul george ringo\fR
.IP
This will create print quota entries for users john, paul, george
and ringo on all printers. These print quota entries will have no
limit set.
.IP
\f(CW$ edpykota --printer lp -S 50 -H 60 jerome\fR
.IP
This will set jerome's print quota on the lp printer to a soft limit
of 50 pages, and a hard limit of 60 pages. Both user jerome and
printer lp have been previously created with the pkusers and pkprinters
commands, respectively.
.IP
\f(CW$ edpykota -g -S 500 -H 550 financial support\fR
.IP
This will set print quota soft limit to 500 pages and hard limit
to 550 pages for groups financial and support on all printers.
.IP
\f(CW$ edpykota --reset jerome "jo*"\fR
.IP
This will reset jerome's page counter to zero on all printers, as
well as every user whose name begins with 'jo'.
Their life time page counter on each printer will be kept unchanged.
You can also reset the life time page counters by using the
\fB\-\-hardreset\fR | \fB\-R\fR command line option.
.IP
\f(CW$ edpykota --printer hpcolor --noquota jerome\fR
.IP
This will tell PyKota to not limit jerome when printing on the
hpcolor printer. All his jobs will be allowed on this printer, but

Print Quotas for jerome on other printers are unchanged.
.IP
\f(CW$ edpykota --delete --printer "HP*,XER*" jerome rachel\fR
.IP
This will delete users jerome and rachel's print quota
entries on all printers which name begin with 'HP' or
