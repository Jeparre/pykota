pkturnkey v1.26_fixes_official (c) 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 Jerome Alet \- alet@librelogiciel.com
.PP
A turn key tool for PyKota. When launched, this command will initialize
PyKota's database with all existing print queues and some or all users.
For now, no prices or limits are set, so printing is fully accounted
for, but not limited. That's why you'll probably want to also use
edpykota once the database has been initialized.

Will simulate the initialization of PyKota's database will all existing
printers and print accounts for all users whose uid is greater than
or equal to jerome's one. Won't manage any users group.

To REALLY initialize the database instead of simulating it, please
use the \fB\-f\fR | \fB\-\-force\fR command line switch.

You can limit the initialization to only a subset of the existing
printers, by passing their names at the end of the command line.
