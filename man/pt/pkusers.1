.PP
command line usage :
.IP

.PP
or :
.IP
pkusers \fB\-\-groups\fR [options] group1 group2 group3 ... groupN
.PP
options :
.TP
\fB\-v\fR | \fB\-\-version\fR
Prints pkusers's version number then exits.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR | \fB\-\-help\fR
Prints this message then exits.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR | \fB\-\-add\fR
Adds users if they don't exist on the database.
If they exist, they are modified unless
\fB\-s\fR|\-\-skipexisting is also used.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR | \fB\-\-delete\fR
Deletes users from the quota storage.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR | \fB\-\-email\fR addr
Sets the email address for the users.
If the addr parameter begins with @, then
the username is prepended to addr to form
a valid email address.
.HP
\fB\-D\fR | \fB\-\-description\fR d Adds a textual description to users or groups.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR | \fB\-\-groups\fR
Edit users groups instead of users.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR | \fB\-\-overcharge\fR f
Sets the overcharging factor applied to the user
when computing the cost of a print job. Positive or
negative floating point values are allowed,
this allows you to do some really creative
things like giving money to an user whenever
he prints. The number of pages in a print job
is not modified by this coefficient, only the
cost of the job for a particular user.
Only users have such a coefficient.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR | \fB\-\-ingroups\fR g1[,g2...]
Puts the users into each of the groups
listed, separated by commas. The groups
must already exist in the Quota Storage.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR | \fB\-\-list\fR
Lists users or groups.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR | \fB\-\-limitby\fR l
Choose if the user/group is limited in printing
by its account balance or by its page quota.
The default value is 'quota'. Allowed values
are 'quota' 'balance' 'noquota' 'noprint'
and 'nochange' :
.IP
\- quota : limit by number of pages per printer.
\- balance : limit by number of credits in account.
\- noquota : no limit, accounting still done.
\- nochange : no limit, accounting not done.
\- noprint : printing is denied.
.IP
NB : nochange and noprint are not supported for groups.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR | \fB\-\-balance\fR b
Sets the user's account balance to b.
Account balance may be increase or decreased
if b is prefixed with + or \-.
WARNING : when decreasing account balance,
the total paid so far by the user is decreased
too.
Groups don't have a real balance, but the
sum of their users' account balance.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR | \fB\-\-comment\fR txt
Defines some informational text to be associated
with a change to an user's account balance.
Only meaningful if \fB\-b\fR | \fB\-\-balance\fR is also used.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR | \fB\-\-remove\fR
In combination with the \fB\-\-ingroups\fR option above,
remove users from the specified users groups.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR | \fB\-\-skipexisting\fR
In combination with the \fB\-\-add\fR option above, tells
pkusers to not modify existing users.
.IP
user1 through userN and group1 through groupN can use wildcards
if the \fB\-\-add\fR option is not set.
.PP
examples :
.IP
\f(CW$ pkusers --add john paul george ringo/ringo@example.com\fR
.IP
This will add users john, paul, george and ringo to the quota
database. User ringo's email address will also be set to
\&'ringo@example.com'
.IP
\f(CW$ pkusers --ingroups coders,it jerome\fR
.IP
User jerome is put into the groups "coders" and "it" which must
already exist in the quota database.
.IP
\f(CW$ pkusers --limitby balance jerome\fR
.IP
This will tell PyKota to limit jerome by his account's balance
when printing.
.IP
\f(CW$ pkusers --balance +10.0 --comment "He paid with his blood !" jerome\fR
.IP
This will increase jerome's account balance by 10.0 (in your
own currency). You can decrease the account balance with a
dash prefix, and set it to a fixed amount with no prefix.
A comment will be stored for this balance change.
.IP
\f(CW$ pkusers --delete jerome rachel\fR
.IP
This will completely delete jerome and rachel from the quota
database. All their quotas and jobs will be deleted too.
.IP
\f(CW$ pkusers --overcharge 2.5 poorstudent\fR
.IP
This will overcharge the poorstudent user by a factor of 2.5.
.IP
\f(CW$ pkusers --overcharge -1 jerome\fR
.IP
User jerome will actually earn money whenever he prints.
.IP
\f(CW$ pkusers --overcharge 0 boss\fR
.IP
User boss can print at will, it won't cost him anything because the
cost of each print job will be multiplied by zero before charging
his account.
.IP
\f(CW$ pkusers --email @example.com\fR
.IP
This will set the email address for each user to username@example.com
