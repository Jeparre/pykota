examples :
.IP
Using pkbanner directly from the command line is not recommended,
excepted for testing purposes. You should use pkbanner in the
\&'startingbanner' or 'endingbanner' directives in pykota.conf
.IP
startingbanner: /usr/bin/pkbanner \fB\-\-logo=\fR"" \fB\-\-savetoner\fR=\fI75\fR
.IP
With such a setting in pykota.conf, all print jobs will be
prefixed with an A4 banner with no logo, and text luminosity will
be increased by 75%. The PostScript output will be directly sent
to your printer.
.IP
You'll find more examples in the sample configuration file included
in PyKota.
