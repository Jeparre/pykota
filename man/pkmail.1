This command is meant to be used from your mail server's aliases file,
as a pipe. It will then accept commands send to it in email messages,
and will send the answer to the command's originator.
.IP
To use this command, create an email alias in /etc/aliases with
the following format :
.IP
pykotacmd: "|/usr/bin/pkmail"
.IP
Then run the 'newaliases' command to regenerate the aliases database.
.IP
You can now send commands by email to 'pykotacmd@yourdomain.com', with
the command in the subject.

NB : For pkmail to work correctly, you may have to put the 'mail'
system user in the 'pykota' system group to ensure this user can
read the /etc/pykota/pykotadmin.conf file, and restart your
mail server (e.g. /etc/init.d/exim restart). It is strongly advised
that you think at least twice before doing this though.
