.SH DESCRIPTION
pknotify v1.26_fixes_official (c) 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 Jerome Alet \- alet@librelogiciel.com
.PP
Notifies or ask questions to end users who launched the PyKotIcon application.
.PP
command line usage :
.TP
pknotify
[options]  [arguments]
.PP
options :
.TP
\fB\-v\fR | \fB\-\-version\fR
Prints pknotify's version number then exits.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR | \fB\-\-help\fR
Prints this message then exits.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR | \fB\-\-destination\fR h[:p]
Sets the destination hostname and optional
port onto which contact the remote PyKotIcon
application. This option is mandatory.
When not specified, the port defaults to 7654.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR | \fB\-\-ask\fR
Tells pknotify to ask something to the end
user. Then pknotify will output the result.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR | \fB\-\-checkauth\fR
When \fB\-\-ask\fR is used and both an 'username' and a
\&'password' are asked to the end user, then
pknotify will try to authenticate the user
through PAM. If authentified, this program
will print "AUTH=YES", else "AUTH=NO".
If a field is missing, "AUTH=IMPOSSIBLE" will
be printed. If the user is authenticated, then
"USERNAME=xxxx" will be printed as well.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR | \fB\-\-confirm\fR
Tells pknotify to ask for either a confirmation
or abortion.
.TP
\fB\-D\fR | \fB\-\-denyafter\fR N
With \fB\-\-checkauth\fR above, makes pknotify loop
up to N times if the password is incorrect.
After having reached the limit, "DENY" will
be printed, which effectively rejects the job.
The default value of N is 1, meaning the job
is denied after the first unsuccessful try.
.TP
\fB\-N\fR | \fB\-\-noremote\fR action
If it's impossible to connect to the remote
PyKotIcon machine, do this action instead.
Allowed actions are 'CONTINUE' and 'CANCEL',
which will respectively allow the processing
of the print job to continue, or the job to
be cancelled. The default value is CANCEL.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR | \fB\-\-notify\fR
Tells pknotify to send an informational message
to the end user.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR | \fB\-\-quit\fR
Tells pknotify to send a message asking the
PyKotIcon application to exit. This option can
be combined with the other ones to make PyKotIcon
exit after having sent the answer from the dialog.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR | \fB\-\-timeout\fR T
Tells pknotify to ignore the end user's answer if
it comes past T seconds after the dialog box being
opened. The default value is 0 seconds, which
tells pknotify to wait indefinitely.
Use this option to avoid having an user who
leaved his computer stall a whole print queue.
.IP
You MUST specify either \fB\-\-ask\fR, \fB\-\-confirm\fR, \fB\-\-notify\fR or \fB\-\-quit\fR.
.IP
arguments :
.HP
\fB\-a\fR | \fB\-\-ask\fR : Several arguments are accepted, of the form
.IP
"label:varname:defaultvalue". The result will
be printed to stdout in the following format :
VAR1NAME=VAR1VALUE
VAR2NAME=VAR2VALUE
\&...
If the dialog was cancelled, nothing will be
printed. If one of the varname is 'password'
then this field is asked as a password (you won't
see what you type in), and is NOT printed. Although
it is not printed, it will be used to check if
authentication is valid if you specify \fB\-\-checkauth\fR.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR | \fB\-\-confirm\fR : A single argument is expected, representing the
message to display. If the dialog is confirmed
then pknotify will print OK, else CANCEL.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR | \fB\-\-notify\fR : A single argument is expected, representing the
message to display. In this case pknotify will
always print OK.
.PP
examples :
.IP
pknotify \fB\-d\fR client:7654 \fB\-\-noremote\fR CONTINUE \fB\-\-confirm\fR "This job costs 10 credits"
.IP
Would display the cost of the print job and asks for confirmation.
If the end user doesn't have PyKotIcon running and accepting connections
from the print server, PyKota will consider that the end user accepted
to print this job.
.IP
pknotify \fB\-\-destination\fR $PYKOTAJOBORIGINATINGHOSTNAME:7654 \e
.IP
\fB\-\-checkauth\fR \fB\-\-ask\fR "Your name:username:" "Your password:password:"
.IP
Asks an username and password, and checks if they are valid.
NB : The PYKOTAJOBORIGINATINGHOSTNAME environment variable is
only set if you launch pknotify from cupspykota through a directive
in ~pykota/pykota.conf
.IP
The TCP port you'll use must be reachable on the client from the
print server.
