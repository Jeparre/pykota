Job price is optional.
If both are to be set, separate them with a comma.
Floating point and negative values are allowed.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR | \fB\-\-groups\fR pg1[,pg2...] Adds or Remove the printer(s) to the printer
groups pg1, pg2, etc... which must already exist.
A printer group is just like a normal printer,
only that it is usually unknown from the printing
system. Create printer groups exactly the same
way that you create printers, then add other
printers to them with this option.
Accounting is done on a printer and on all
the printer groups it belongs to, quota checking
is done on a printer and on all the printer groups
it belongs to.
If the \fB\-\-remove\fR option below is not used, the
default action is to add printers to the specified
printer groups.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR | \fB\-\-list\fR
List informations about the printer(s) and the
printers groups it is a member of.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR | \fB\-\-remove\fR
In combination with the \fB\-\-groups\fR option above,
remove printers from the specified printers groups.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR | \fB\-\-skipexisting\fR
In combination with the \fB\-\-add\fR option above, tells
pkprinters to not modify existing printers.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR | \fB\-\-maxjobsize\fR s
Sets the maximum job size allowed on the printer
to s pages.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR | \fB\-\-passthrough\fR
Activate passthrough mode for the printer. In this
mode, users are allowed to print without any impact
on their quota or account balance.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR | \fB\-\-nopassthrough\fR Deactivate passthrough mode for the printer.
Without \fB\-p\fR or \fB\-n\fR, printers are created in
normal mode, i.e. no passthrough.

is not set.
